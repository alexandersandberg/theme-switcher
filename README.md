# CSS Only Theme Switcher

## About the project

This is a website theme switcher made with CSS only. There are two different versions of this:

1. Using a checkbox to switch between two themes
2. Using radio buttons for unlimited amount of themes

I also wrote [an article on my website](https://alexandersandberg.com/theme-switcher/) explaining the functionality behind this solution, for those interested.

## Usage

[**Check it out live**](https://alexandersandberg.github.io/theme-switcher/) _or_ download the files and open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
